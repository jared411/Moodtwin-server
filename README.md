# MoodTwin Server — Render Manual Deploy

This repository is a lightweight backend for MoodTwin.
It provides two main endpoints:

- `POST /api/train` — body: `{ texts: string[] , twinName?: string }`
  - Stores a twin profile and returns `{ ok:true, twinId, profile }`

- `POST /api/chat` — body: `{ twinId: string, message: string, mood?: string }`
  - Returns `{ ok:true, reply }` where `reply` is generated by OpenAI.

## Quick Deploy on Render (Manual Upload)

1. Go to https://render.com and create a free account.
2. Click **New** → **Web Service**.
3. Choose **Manual deploy** (Upload a repository) — upload the ZIP file produced here.
4. For **Build Command** leave empty; for **Start Command** use: `npm start`
5. Add an environment variable on Render: `OPENAI_API_KEY` with your OpenAI key.
6. Deploy. After build & deploy you will get a URL like `https://<your-service>.onrender.com`.
7. Use that URL as your backend base in your web/mobile apps, e.g:
   `VITE_BACKEND_BASE=https://<your-service>.onrender.com`

## Notes & Security
- This prototype stores profiles in `data/profiles.json` on the instance. Persisted across restarts while the instance disk remains.
- Do NOT store sensitive user info without consent. Add auth before public launch.
- Change `model` in server.js to one you have access to on OpenAI.
